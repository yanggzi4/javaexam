Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

Q. why do we need data structure?
A.Data structures helps in increasing the efficiency of the program or application since it organizes data in such a
manner that it uses less memory and higher processing speed. Data structures provide the reusability of the data and
can be used many times.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
A.various operations that can be performed on different data structures are as follows:
*traversing- visit the element stored in a data structure.
*searching- to find a particular element in a data structure
*insertion- add an element in the given data structure
*deletion- delete an element in the given data structure
*create, selection, sort, update, merge etc.

Q. List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
A. Data structures are applied extensively in the field of compiler design, operating systems, data management systems,
statistical analysis package, numerical analysis, graphics, artificial intelligence and Simulation.

Q. What is an Array?
A.An array is a data structure used to store multiple values in a single variable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
A.Array is an object which contains elements of same data type whereas ArrayList is a class of collection framework.
Arrays are static in nature whereas ArrayList is dynamic.

Q. What is LinkedList?
A. LinkedList class is a collection which can contain many objects of the same type, just like ArrayList.LinkedList has
same methods as ArrayList but they are built differently.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. How is an ArrayList different from Linked List?
A.ArrayList class has a regular array inside it.when an element is added, it is placed into the array but if it doesn't
 fit anymore then whole array is replaced with the new array list whereas LinkedList stores  it items in "containers",
 the list has a link to the first container and each container has a link to the next container in the list so when
 the new element is added it is stored in a new container and linked.
 ArrayList works better when application demands storing the data and accessing it whereas LinkedList works better
  when the application demands the manipulation of the stored date.
